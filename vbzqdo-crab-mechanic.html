Like, why is the current scuttle crab mechanic even implemented into the game? Did anybody ask for it? No. Did anybody say it's a good idea when it was introduced on the PBE? No. Does it solve any jungle issues? Hell no, it only increases them. It also brings the smite to the mid lanes as a very viable option. Just. Here's a "principle" i think should be in game modes - If it can't be completely fixed in the engine it should be allowed. Mules as an example of unfixable in game problem. Engine Fix 1: Ban trading to end mules. \-- Results in people just killing their alts. Engine Fix 2: Ban trading and picking up items \-- Completely ruins DMM. There is no engine fix for mules that doesn't completely ruin the game. Point is, if the mechanic can't be fixed in the engine, then they should. 
Finally got to fight Oryx again in D2. Feels nice to here the Kings voice again. Clan and I were talking this weekend while at Corp and were wondering which monster would be the most feared in OSRS - which ones have the highest player kills. We thought Zuk might be winning in kills/death, but surely not in sheer numbers of player kills.  # History I know there are alot of new deeeep.io players everyday that come here to learn more about the game.

So I'm really enjoying homecoming, but I've noticed a lot of other people aren't. I'm curious what exactly you guys think should be changed, so I'm going to work on a spreadsheet outlining the changes you guys would like to see in upcoming patches which I'll post a link to here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12i4fUW38hQRWam4aDpV3WBkqLDye7fXvsv6SXtc53Vw/edit?usp=sharing) and if you guys are interested in giving advice/opinions I'd love to hear it, either in the comments below or comment. So goons have been defeated in the past by two major wars. Most recently WWB. Each time they come back stronger and now look to be in a position where they are making incredible isk ( and lets face it that's what holding sob null and fozzie sov was about) it's not their fault you so called leet pvp alliances couldn't be arsed mining and shit. anyway I digress you've had a chance to finish off goons in WWB but let them take delve and rebuild and now possibly destroying you all. Don't. 
At this point I'm the game the scuttle crab gives the early game such a huge advantage in the early game for junglers and objective control in the mid/late game. The fact that the crab doesn't attack doesn't help its cause. What if Riot where to make a change to the crabs mechanics. It would still run away and have plenty of armor but damaging the crab would do something similar to thornmail. Maybe % damage to current health to whoever is attacking Also can you even get any block chance from other sources if you use two-handers that are not staves. Feels Edit: Title should read "explain it to me." damn autocorrect Hey there, I recently bought 3 coresets and now i'm trying to wrap my head around the several gameplans of the different clans, making comparisons to well- known Magic archetypes for ease of understanding. So i compared them to so far - Lion: feels a lot Like White weenie/typical Aggro. Go wide and Swing - Crane: Maybe blue control? - Scorpion: Mono black? - Dragon: Big green with enchantments I don't really know about Hello all, The question is most in the title, but I was wondering if there ever was a political counterpart to Crab's very defensive military. I'm going to be running a campaign for some of my players and was curious on some rules. One of my players wants to play a Bushi from the Crab Clan, however he wants to use the Yari spear. He understands that he would also have his Daisho. Now I don't find him wanting to use a Yari spear all that problematic, but all the Hida School techniques (for the most part) specify Heavy Weapons. He would prefer to use the Hida because it matches his concept better, so any help or advice would be prefe. So i decided i'd follow the creed of the SunBro and place my summon sign to help someone out, after i appear i see a crab and my first thought was that the Host was being attacked by a crab and a moundmaker, then i realized the host was THE CRAB, i'm going to assume it's a mod, but still what the fuck and how the fuck? Oh, and that giant was invincible. view for man-crab, or is it crab-man?
