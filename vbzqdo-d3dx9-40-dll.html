I recently got a new custom built gaming computer, and everything's been running fine, apart from when I tried to play gmod. When installing it, on the first time startup, I'm met with this error: https://i.imgur.com/NE8Z2TS.png (https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://i.imgur.com/NE8Z2TS.png) And then, when I follow the 'help' they provide, telling me to run DXSETUP.EXE to update/install my DirectX, it says this: https://i.imgur.com/CLLocPd.png (https://steamcommunity.com/li. ¬∑ –ó–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã –Ω–µ–≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–µ–Ω, —Ç–∞–∫ –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–µ –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç —Ñ–∞–π–ª dll, –≥–¥–µ —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å dll —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã? ü§îüíªüí• - Duration:.

So first I accidentally posted this to the wrong channel. Here I try again. I'm not super new to Unix and also not too deep into the materia. Let's say I'm studying. I was using Linux since years but mostly GUI. I just started using the shell more often. But that's off topic anyway. My problem is this: There are some games that I can't run. At the moment it is Anno 1404. I also have Civilization V installed which runs flawlessly. But installing Anno 1404 I get an error message close –ü—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω—ã –æ—à–∏–±–æ–∫ –≤ —Ñ–∞–π–ª–µ D3DX9_40.dll. –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –æ—à–∏–±–æ–∫ D3DX9_40.dll —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–æ —Å –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ–º –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤ D3DX9_40.dll. It seems to inject through thwarglelauncher just fine and stops the starting video and crap from appearing. Only problem is that once I'm ingame I don't see anything! It seemed to stop working after installing some new toolbelt thing I saw on the discord. I also noticed the last time it was working my pause/insert key wouldn't start or stop my vtank macros. I've tried resetting the bar position, reinstalling following the gdle directions, copying and pasting over the portal.dat and acclien.

''' Hello, I'm not a very new Linux user nor am I very deep into the Unix system. I recently got a game that I'd like to play again and installed it via wine. Starting Anno 1404 I can see the ingame mouse for a second before it crashes. I run Manjaro Linux with wine-4.0-rc6. Here's the terminal output. Maybe someone can find something and is actually able to help me. Thanks in advance! amp#x200B; cmon@cmon ~gt primusrun wine ~/.wine/drive_c/GOG\ Games/Anno\ 1404\ Gold\ Edition/Anno.

Recently I‚Äôve run into an issue with my Directx where when I try and play specific games (like Gmod) it tells me I‚Äôm missing file ‚ÄúD3DX9_40.dll‚Äù which is needed in order to complete setup. I‚Äôve played Gmod on this computer before with no hassle but had to restore my computer because my windows ran into an issue that forced me to restore it back to defaults. I‚Äôve looked online - nothing helpful despite trying many things I‚Äôve contacted Microsoft - told me ‚Äúguaranteed 101%‚Äù my issue Had Skyrim running fine for a while, subbed out one or two mods and it subsequently died a death. Whenever I attempt to start up the game it will pass the Skyrim logo, ENB will show in the top left, and about 2 seconds afterwards it CTDs. I've LOOTed, Bashed, and spent nearly 12 hours searching for a solution. Couldn't find anything. managed to figure out how to get a Crashdump file readable and found the exception code with information "The thread tried to read from or write to a virtual addres. Hi, so i have Payday 2 for a while now but recently wanted to start playing again. So i reinstalled it on my laptop and my desktop. While it works perfectly fine on my desktop, it doesn't work at all on my laptop. as it says in the title, when opening the game via steam it gives me the "preparing to load PAYDAY2" but when it opens it gives me a black full screen, then it flickers, becomes windowed and then closes. I've tried reinstalling multiple times but it hasn't worked, even when deleting. Hey-o, I hope you are well! I am requesting help on a crash upon which I am at wit's end currently. It is a persistent ctd that occurs on new saves only with my fully loaded mod list within the Windhelm area. I have currently tried I feel everything except for actually combining esp in tes5edit. I have created a merged plugin list though. I have checked memory block usage which is at 512/256. I have deleted and reinstalled skyrim along with all my mods a total of three times, I have systematical. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated! Here's the backstory. I got CrossOver on my MacBook (2008) so I could play Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Then I was able to download Steam and install the game. All was well, everything worked great, no problems. But then I had to update Steam. When I clicked on Rebellion in Steam to play, it would go to a black screen and never load, had to Force Quit "Wineloader." (I got Wineskin initially when trying to figure out how to play Rebellion). Ok.so I just made an account on Steam and downloaded Dawn of Discovery Gold Edition. Once the download was done I tried to run the game but nothing happens. I go to Library and click the play game icon. Nothing happens. Even clicking the shortcuts on the desktop the game does not run. it doesnt even start up. Yes. I made sure I was logged into to Steam when I was trying to run the game. I even went into my Steam directory and tried to start the game directly. A warning came up saying. Hello, I have been experiencing a crashing problem the last 4-5 days with ROE. typically the game crashes right as i am coming into a map (right after you pick spawn location) then if i reload ROE it will let me back into the match only to crash a minute or two later. amp#x200B; So far i have tried the following; amp#x200B; 1) complete uninstall of ROE from steam (include deleting old folders) and then re-install 2) update all drivers on pc. 3) Run everything in admin \# \# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: \# \# EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x000000007559ba5c, pid=1608, tid=4424 \# \# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0\_51-b16) (build 1.8.0\_51-b16) \# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.51-b03 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops) \# Problematic frame: \# C \ nvoglv64.dll+0xbeba5c\ \# \# Failed to write core dump.

Though initially i thought it was my wrapper that broke the game but i found out that it was the new patch since a lot of people were posting about it. Because of the Patch yesterday i was able to test the Wrapper and the Launcher indeed worked and was able to patch my Game. Patching takes time dunno why but just leave it and it will patch the game. amp#x200B; Hi! just wanted to share. I'm trying to run World of Warships using this (https://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-2571-World_Of_Warships.html) PlayOnLinux script.
